#I have used a pre made database that includes customers and sales for different months. The database is called BIT_DB and the sql code has been written in SQLiteStudio.

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid) as 'Number of orders placed in January'
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales


#2. How many of those orders were for an Apple Airpods Headphones? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid) as 'Apple Airpods Headphones Sales'
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='Apple Airpods Headphones'


#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in January. 
SELECT distinct cust.acctnum as 'account number'
FROM BIT_DB.customers as cust

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.JanSales as Jan
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid


#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in February, and what was the price? 

SELECT distinct product, price FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in April?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.AprSales
GROUP BY product

#6. Which products were sold in March at 477 11th St, Seattle, WA 98101 how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select 
sum(Quantity), 
product, 
sum(quantity)*price as revenue,
location
FROM BIT_DB.MarSales 
WHERE location = '477 11th St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
select 
count(distinct cust.acctnum) as 'Number of Customers', 
avg(quantity*price) as 'Average Amount Spent '
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
